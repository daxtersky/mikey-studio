# Mikey Studio

## Intro - [link to Mikey Studio](https://mikey-studio.xyz)

  I wanted to have my portfolio website build with the basic tech stack as possible: Vanilla JavaScript and CSS. All images, except the main one, are mine, stocked in [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). The content is stored in Firebase Database. Send email from website form is possible thanks to AWS Lambda Function.

## Tech stack / code conventions

1.  GitHub Pages - [deployment procedure explained to my future me =D](README-GITHUB-PARCEL.md)

1. Google Firebase Database - all content (except hero section...?) is stored in Firebase database

1. Fetch API & Unsplash images - all images are stored in Unsplash.com loaded with Unsplash API

1. AWS Lambda Function ~~Firebase Cloud Functions~~ due to some auth problems with gmail
