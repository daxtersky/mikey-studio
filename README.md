**# Mikey Studio**

**## Intro - [link to Mikey Studio](https://mikey-studio.xyz)**

Website was build with the basic tech stack: Vanilla JavaScript and CSS. All images, except the main one, are mine, stocked in [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). The content is stored in [Firebase Database](firebase.google.com/). 'Send email from website' form is possible thanks to [AWS Lambda Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

**## Tech stack / code conventions**

1. GitHub Pages - [deployment procedure explained to my future me =D](README-GITHUB-PARCEL.md)

1. Google Firebase Database - all content is stored in Firebase database

1. Fetch API & Unsplash images - all images are stored in Unsplash.com loaded with Unsplash API

1. AWS Lambda Function ~~Firebase Cloud Functions~~ due to some auth problems with gmail permission I used Lambda Functions
